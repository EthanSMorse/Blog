<br>

In the movie WALL-E, there are multiple references to A.I. and what type of jobs we would give them to do, with the one on display being garbage removal. 

A.I. like WALL-E and AUTO are depicted as robots that are capable of complex emotions and rational thoughts: the usual depiction of AI in movies and media in general. Then, this leads into both of their interactions with humans, where WALL-E is friendly, allthough confused, and AUTO is defiant with the goal of not being decommissioned once the ship is landed back on Earth.
