## A.I. in WALL-E:

<br>

In the movie WALL-E, there are multiple references to A.I. and what type of jobs we would give them to do, with the one on display being garbage removal. 

A.I. like WALL-E and AUTO are depicted as robots that are capable of complex emotions and rational thoughts: the usual depiction of AI in movies and media in general. Then, this leads into both of their interactions with humans, where WALL-E is friendly, making him a good protagonist, and AUTO is defiant, and therefore an antagonist, with the goal of not being decommissioned once the ship is landed back on Earth. They both serve their purposes to the story, while also representing a possible future in A.I. development.

## A.I. Ethics:

But with this future being a possibility, we must take a deeper look into the ethical and moral implications of developing A.I. to such a degree.

First off is the obvious dystopian-esque society caused by humans becoming too inactive, simply letting A.I. and robots do everything for them. On the ship, we are introduced to a society where humans cant even walk because they simply dont have too. This, while not too down to Earth for possible futures, is still a consideration that must be taken into account in real life. If we let A.I. do everything for us, the human race will slowly devolve into ineptitude.

Then, there is the much more recognized future of A.I. take over. In the movie, humans had basically relinquished all control to the A.I. that served them, leading to situations like that of AUTO's, who almost killed the first plant that grew on Earth's surface in a millenia or two. This can, very well, transfer into real life, where we may not even need to relinquish control for A.I. to take over. Therefore, we must be sure to put limitations on both the development of A.I., as well as A.I. itself.

## Human A.I. Interaction:



## AI's Role in Society:

But, like I wrote earlier, we must take care to not rely on A.I. too much. 

A perfect example of this is shown
