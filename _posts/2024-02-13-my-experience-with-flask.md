<h1>My Experience With Flask</h1>

## An Introduction to Flask

Most recently, me and my class have been working with a web framework written in Python called Flask. It is actually quite useful, allowing a coder to create dynamic web applications. It is esseantially an addon that makes working with Python much easier, with only one python file being required to change an y other files connected to it.

### Difference from HTML and CSS

Flask allows a coder to run their webiste directly on a web server, as opposed to simply on their device, or locally. This makes thinsg much easier, while also adding a bunch of new abilities, such as the communication between the main python file and the templates through use of functions.

### What additional technologies/languages does it use?

When using Flask, you are able to use a new type of file called a jinja file. What these jinja files allow a coder to do is they allow the use of basic python commands (along with the HTML you would use regularly) such as a for loop. This can be very useful when making a website, as python is definitly not known for it's ability to create the front-end of websites. To put it plainly, it gives you the best of both worlds, without putting any limits on what you can do.

## Resources

When learning Flask, I had access to multiple resources:
- My teacher, Mr. Forlenza
- The Flask documentation
- W3Schools
- Other websites that give basic introductions to Flask

However, of these resources, the one that worked the best for me was most certainly the documentation. Simply by going to the site, you can get an overview of all of Flask's capabilities, commands, and main uses. It helped whenever I didn't know what to put for a specific thing to happen, and whenever I had some sort of error (which was very usually something simple).

## Challenges & Learnings

Naturally, when learning something new, you are bound to make mistakes. This was no different from my experience, where I came across multiple problems in setting up my first Flask application.

Of these problems, one of the most common was that of mismatched names for requesting forms. Here, I got an error when the name I put on an HTML form did not match with a request I made on my python file.
