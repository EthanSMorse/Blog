<h1>My Experience With Flask</h1>

<br>

## An Introduction to Flask

Most recently, me and my class have been working with a web framework written in Python called Flask. It is actually quite useful, allowing a coder to create dynamic web applications. It is essentially an addon that makes working with Python much easier, with only one python file being required to change any other files connected to it.

### Difference from HTML and CSS

Flask allows a coder to run their website directly on a web server, as opposed to simply on their device, or locally. This makes things much easier, while also adding a bunch of new abilities, such as the communication between the main python file and the templates through use of functions.

### What additional technologies/languages does it use?

When using Flask, you are able to use a new type of file called a jinja file. What these jinja files allow a coder to do is they allow the use of basic python commands (along with the HTML you would use regularly) such as a for loop. This can be very useful when making a website, as python is definitely not known for its ability to create the front-end of websites. To put it plainly, it gives you the best of both worlds, without putting any limits on what you can do.

## Resources

When learning Flask, I had access to multiple resources:
- My teacher, Mr. Forlenza
- The Flask documentation
- W3Schools
- Other websites that give basic introductions to Flask

However, of these resources, the one that worked the best for me was most certainly the documentation. Simply by going to the site, you can get an overview of all of Flask's capabilities, commands, and main uses. It helped whenever I didn't know what to put for a specific thing to happen, and whenever I had some sort of error (which was very usually something simple). Therefore, I would very much recommend that people new to Flask take a look at the documentation.

## Challenges & Learnings

Naturally, when learning something new, you are bound to make mistakes. This was no different from my experience, where I came across multiple problems in setting up my first Flask application.

Of these problems, one of the most common was that of mismatched names for requesting forms. Here, I got an error when the name I put on an HTML form did not match with a request I made on my python file. In order to solve this problem, I would usually ask my teacher or peers to look over my code, and they would see the problem. You should never underestimate the help you can get from an extra pair of eyes.

Another problem that I would run into on occasion would be that of database integration. Here, I kept on making mistakes in my SQL code when trying to send and receive info from my jinja files. SQL can be relatively easy to use, but this was yet another thing that I was not very knowledgeable on at the time. For this problem, I would always go straight to my jinja, and give it a once-over. It would most usually be a misspelled form method.

## My Social Media Project

Using everything that I had learned, I was tasked with creating my very own social media website: C'mere!

Within this website, there were multiple functionalities that I had just learned to create, such as:
- User sign-up
- User sign-in
- Storage of user data
- Making posts to a communal feed page

Additionally, while integrating these functionalities, I had learned quite a lot of interesting things. I learned what would happen if you accidentally refreshed the sign-up page, adding multiple iterations of the same data to my database. I learned what would happen when multiple iterations of the same login were included in the database.

All in all, my entire experience with flask was quite a fun ride. There is nothing I could say, but to try it for yourself.
