<h1>Python ToDo List</h1>

<br>

My most recent project was that of a python ToDo list.

The process was pretty straight forward, as we have done something like this once before in a much larger depth.

I first started making an empty list, the one that would be filled by the user. 

```
todo = []
```

I did make a small mistake here initially, by putting quotation marks inside of the brackets. This added an item to the list, which is not what I wanted to happen. I quickly remedied this simply by removing the quotation marks.
